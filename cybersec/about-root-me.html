            <h2>About Root-me.org</h2>

            <p>
                This post is mainly a rant about the rules on <a href="https://root-me.org/">Root-me.org</a> and how the website is managed.
            </p>

            <p>
                As you may have noticed, my website hosts writeups about multiple Root-me challenges, which is against what's stated in <a href="https://www.root-me.org/?page=structure&inc=page-mentions_legales&lang=en">their legal disclaimer</a>.
                Now, why do I do that ? Well, mainly because I believe that people who are stuck deserve more than just cryptic and censored answers on a forum or shouldn't have to create a Discord account just to get a bit of help.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now to those who will say that resources are linked on the challenges' pages, I find it hard to understand how a 1000 pages-long paywalled PDF file (yes, Yurichev now sell their book) is a good resource for a beginner who's stuck on a challenge.
                Also, I still don't understand <a href="https://www.root-me.org/en/Challenges/Cracking/ELF-x86-CrackPass">how paywalling resources</a> is a good idea, but hey, who am I to judge ?
            </p>

            <p>
                Anyway, these writeups are there because I believe that repetition and adaptation of what's already been seen are key steps in learning, and that such informations should be freely accessible.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are on the Root-me team and want me to take these down, feel free to contact me via e-mail, my address is somewhere on this website.

            <p>
                Cheers
